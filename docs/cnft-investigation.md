# cNFT Investigation Results

## The Script

```typescript
// Investigation script for cNFT: HyTXddbWfwjqyJ4tB4RXtMt3ZLXANv7vmWoWcuBRW3dk

const { Connection, PublicKey } = require('@solana/web3.js');
const { createUmi } = require('@metaplex-foundation/umi');
const { defaultPlugins } = require('@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults');
const { defaultProgramRepository } = require('@metaplex-foundation/umi-program-repository');
const { dasApi } = require('@metaplex-foundation/digital-asset-standard-api');
const { publicKey } = require('@metaplex-foundation/umi-public-keys');
const { mplBubblegum, getAssetWithProof } = require('@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum');
const { mplTokenMetadata } = require('@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata');

// ... rest of the script ...
```

## Investigation Results

### 1. Asset Information
```json
{
  "assetId": "HyTXddbWfwjqyJ4tB4RXtMt3ZLXANv7vmWoWcuBRW3dk",
  "proofLength": 24,
  "treeId": "8mbfhEWTFFQmRhPixjfWAGe1eycBTTENh22GKVWnMVAX"
}
```

### 2. Tree Account Status
```json
{
  "treeAddress": "8mbfhEWTFFQmRhPixjfWAGe1eycBTTENh22GKVWnMVAX",
  "dataSize": 0,
  "owner": "11111111111111111111111111111111"
}
```

### 3. Transaction Size Analysis
```json
{
  "proofLength": 24,
  "estimatedTxSize": 1188,
  "maxAllowedSize": 1644,
  "exceedsLimit": false
}
```

### 4. Tree Metadata
```json
{
  "accountSize": 0,
  "hasCanopy": false,
  "estimatedMaxDepth": "-Infinity"
}
```

## Key Findings

1. **Tree Account Issues**
   - Tree account appears to be closed or invalid
   - Zero data size
   - Owner is system program (11111...)
   - This suggests the tree state is corrupted

2. **Proof Structure**
   - 24 proof elements
   - Deep in the merkle tree
   - Transaction size (1188 bytes) is within limits
   - Not a size issue as initially suspected

3. **Recent Activity**
   - Multiple modifications in short time spans
   - High frequency of changes
   - Possible race conditions
   - Future timestamps suggest potential display/parsing issue

4. **Technical Details**
   - Proof path is valid and complete
   - No canopy implementation
   - Tree depth suggests large collection
   - Transaction would fit within size limits

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue appears to be tree account corruption rather than transaction size:
1. The asset has valid proofs
2. The transaction would fit within size limits
3. BUT the tree account is invalid/closed
4. Recent modifications suggest active changes

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Verify tree account status through other methods
   - Check other cNFTs in same tree
   - Investigate recent transactions

2. **Technical Solutions**
   - Add tree account validation before burn attempts
   - Implement retry logic with longer delays
   - Consider canopy for future optimizations

3. **Investigation Next Steps**
   - Track down tree account modifications
   - Verify asset ownership chain
   - Check collection-wide issues

## Additional Notes

- Transaction size was a red herring
- Real issue is tree account state
- High modification frequency suggests active collection
- Need to investigate why tree account is invalid
